# Travel app

This project requires you to build a travel application that obtains the travel location and date from the user and uses the information obtained from the external API to display the weather and images of the travel location.

## Get Up and Running

Fork this repo, then clone the branch of your choice from your forked repo down to your computer:

```

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm test``` to test the app
- ```npm run build-dev``` to build a development environment
